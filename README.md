Compute time for viewing all episodes in a directory

# Why this ?

So I decided to binge watch Doctor Who 2005 revised, because sci-fi + rom-com + time travel + brit.

I ended up watching it in 9 days flat (9 seasons+Specials). When I tried to find
the running time, different sources (tiii.me, binge-clock, stackexchange, reddit)
, all gave different answers, but clearly all incorrect. So this.

# How to use it 

Clone this - `git clone https://github.com/kaustubhhiware/binge-timer.git`

cd into folder

run with `python timer.py`

Enter destination for folder(Expected format) : 

    Doctor Who -
        Season 1(or whatever) -
            S01E01 - (any name works)
            S01E02 - 
        Season 2 -
                S02E01 -
                S02E02

A file binge-timer.txt is the report, saved in the same path as the season folders.See the [sample.](binge-timer.txt)
